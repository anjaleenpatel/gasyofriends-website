        <h1>About GasYoFriends</h1>
        <p>GasYoFriends is a text service created for the community to spread positivity. It's designed to make it easy for people to send anonymous compliments to each other, fostering a culture of encouragement and love.</p>
        <p>This is not a business but a personal project that I hope turns into a community-wide tool for spreading positivity and love. I will be promoting it via social media and other community channels to reach as many people as possible.</p>
        <p>Thank you for being a part of this journey. Together, we can make a difference, one compliment at a time.</p>
